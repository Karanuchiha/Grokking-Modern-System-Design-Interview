# Design of a Distributed Logging Service
We’ll design the distributed logging system now. Our logging system should log all activities or messages (we’ll not incorporate sampling ability into our design).

## Requirements
Let’s list the requirements for designing a distributed logging system:

### Functional requirements
### Non-functional requirements
## Building blocks we will use
## API design
## Initial design
## Logging at various levels
### In a server
### At datacenter level
## Conclusion
