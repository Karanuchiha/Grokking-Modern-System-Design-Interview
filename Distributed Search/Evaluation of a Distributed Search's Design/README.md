# Evaluation of a Distributed Search's Design

## Availability
We utilized distributed storage to store these items:

- Documents crawled by the indexer.
- Inverted indexes generated by the indexing nodes.

Data is replicated across multiple regions in distributed storage, making cross-region deployment for indexing and search easier. The group of indexing and search nodes merely needs to be replicated in different availability zones. Therefore, we deploy the cluster of indexing and search nodes in different availability zones. So, if a failure occurs in one place, we can process the requests from another cluster. Multiple groups of indexing and search nodes help to achieve high indexing and search availability. Moreover, in each cluster, if a node dies, another can take its place.

The indexing is performed offline, not on the user’s critical path. We don’t need to replicate the indexing operations synchronously. It is unnecessary to respond to the user search queries with the latest data that has just been added to the index. So, we don’t have to wait for the replication of the new index to respond to the search queries. This makes the search available to the users.

```
Note: Once we replicate the latest data in all groups of indexing nodes and the search nodes have downloaded it, then the search queries are performed on the latest data.
```
## Scalability
## Fast search on big data
## Reduced cost
